3. **Delete this Rule** – Removes the selected add/deduct time rule from the system.
4. **Rule Name** – The name of the rule you’re creating or editing (e.g., “30 Min. Lunch Deduction”) to easily identify it.
5. **Type (Add/Deduct)** – Lets you choose whether this rule adds time to employees’ hours or deducts time from them.
6. **Minutes** – Specifies how many minutes will be added or deducted from the employee’s total time.
7. **After (Hours Worked)** – Defines after how many hours worked this rule will apply (e.g., deduct 30 minutes after 6 hours worked).
