# Users

This section allows you to create new users, assign roles (such as employee, manager, or administrator), set login credentials, configure pay rates, and control access permissions. By managing users here, you ensure every employee has the correct setup for time tracking, scheduling, and reporting.

***

**Active Users Only (Dropdown)**

Filters the list of users shown — you can view only active users or include archived/inactive ones.

***

**User List Panel**

Displays all employees/users in your company account. Clicking a name lets you view or edit that user’s details.

***

**Add User**

Button to create a new user profile.

***

**Select to Archive**

Lets you archive (deactivate) selected users without deleting their records.

***

**Import Excel**

Allows you to bulk-upload user information from an Excel file to quickly add multiple employees.

***

**Tabs (General / Personal / Access / Employment / Notes)**

Switch between different sections of the user profile:

* **General:** Basic user info (name, username, email).
* **Personal:** Employee’s personal details (address, phone, etc.).
* **Access:** Role, permissions, and login credentials.
* **Employment:** Job-related information like department, pay rate, or hire date.
* **Notes:** Add custom notes about the employee.

***

**User Information Fields**

Fields to edit or add employee’s name, username, and email address.

***

**Delete This User**

Option to permanently delete a user from the system (use carefully — this removes their account).
