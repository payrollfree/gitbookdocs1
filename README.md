Open Time Clock is a reliable, secure, cloud and web based time clock system that helps any size business manage time sheets. Our employee time management app was designed to help business owners, bookkeepers and payroll professionals to track employee's time, attendance, paid time off accruals, scheduled shifts, jobs and shift notes. Our Free Plan is available with unlimited managers and employees with access to all features except reports. Open Time Clock allows you to manage your employees access to the platform by restricting their access to specific networks, devices or GPS zones. Web camera and face recognition are supported to avoid 3rd parties punching in and out.
